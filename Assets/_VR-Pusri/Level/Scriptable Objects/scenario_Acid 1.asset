  title: Working with Acid Chemical
  description: Work safely and responsibly in the laboratory, reducing the risk of
    accidents or injuries.
  about: 'In this VR scenario, you will learn about the important Occupational Health
    and Safety (OHS) measures that you should follow when working in a laboratory.
    You will learn how to research the hazardous properties of chemicals, identify
    and use necessary OHS equipment, and prepare reagent solutions according to established
    procedures.


    Additionally, you will learn how to store chemicals safely
    and how to clean up spills or accidents promptly and safely. By following these
    OHS measures, you can work safely and responsibly in the laboratory, reducing
    the risk of accidents or injuries.'
